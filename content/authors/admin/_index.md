I am particularly interested in approximate inference for neural networks and Bayesian optimization. I want to design algorithms that can incorporate prior knowledge, quantify uncertainty, and out-of-distribution detection for large dataset. Especially in the context of neural networks, these problems remain challenging. I have previously worked on methods for time series, image detection and client segmentation.
